Notes for things to consider along the way:
In README.md setup, can I replace "n/a" with any helpful images?



Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.

-- Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.

-- Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.

The most important part of this code review is using and demonstrating your understanding of constructors and prototypes.


Constructors and prototypes are used successfully.

Application works as expected.


Required functionality is in place by the 5:00pm Friday deadline.

Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.

Reach Goals:
Style your site with CSS and images.

Allow users to order more than one pizza with different toppings.

Display the list of pizzas ordered as links that can be clicked for details.

Offer a delivery option that then requires address information.
