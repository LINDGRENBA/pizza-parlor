Notes for things to consider along the way:
In README.md setup, can I replace "n/a" with any helpful images?
Should each topping have an id so user can select which toppings to delete?

need to figure out how to fix spacing of Known Bugs table in README.md. When viewed on github, section for bug is large while section for how fixed is tiny...


Reach Goals:
Style your site with CSS and images.

Allow users to order more than one pizza with different toppings.

Display the list of pizzas ordered as links that can be clicked for details.

Offer a delivery option that then requires address information.
