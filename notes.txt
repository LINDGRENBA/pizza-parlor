Notes for things to consider along the way:
In README.md setup, can I replace "n/a" with any helpful images?



Create a website for a pizza company where a user can choose one or more individual toppings (cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy, etc) and a size to order a pizza and see the final cost.

-- Allow the user to choose toppings and size for the pizza they'd like to order.

-- Create a pizza object constructor with properties for toppings and size.

-- Create a prototype method for the cost of a pizza depending on the selections chosen. Use your own formula for this.

-- Keep it simple to start! You do not need to have a complex formula for determining cost (although you can if you like). The most important part of this code review is using and demonstrating your understanding of constructors and prototypes.

Code meets standards from previous weeks.

Constructors and prototypes are used successfully.

Application works as expected.

Plain English specs are included in your README.

Required functionality is in place by the 5:00pm Friday deadline.

Project is in a polished, portfolio-quality state.

Project demonstrates an understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you can 
discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.

Reach Goals:
Style your site with CSS and images.

Allow users to order more than one pizza with different toppings.

Display the list of pizzas ordered as links that can be clicked for details.

Offer a delivery option that then requires address information.
